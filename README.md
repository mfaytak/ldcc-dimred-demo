# Dependencies
To follow along on your own device, you can install **Jupyter notebook** by following the instructions here: https://jupyter.org/install

You may also need to install the **scikit-learn** library, which can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html . scikit-learn requires Python v3.5 or greater.

One file required to completely run the notebook is ``frames_proc.npy``. See instructions in the ``caches/NC05`` directory to download this file, at which point you should place it in that directory for the notebook to find.
